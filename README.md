<h1 align="center">Rida Challenge</h1>

In Rida, we're not solely looking for the most 'correct' or 'optimal' solution. Instead, we're interested in seeing the creativity of your submission, the quality and readability of your code, the types of dependencies you rely on, the documentation, commit quality, etc. In other words, write something that you'd be proud to present to your team.

Most importantly, make sure you have fun doing the challenge! And of course, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us!

Cheers, Rida's geeks ðŸ¤“

P.s. we'd love some feedback on the challenges too! If you have any feedback, good or bad, let us know in your response!
