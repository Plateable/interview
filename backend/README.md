# Background

Rida is a delivery company that merchants can use to ship orders to their customers.

Naturally, merchants want their products to be delivered as fast as possible.
That is, under ideal circumstances, if they have 5 items, then they would prefer 5 drivers delivering 1 item each to its respective location to expedite delivery.

But sometimes there are not enough drivers. 
Therefore we might need to ask one driver to deliver multiple items (Note: an order could contain multiple items).

Design a system to record all orders and return response for group of items taken by each driver 

# Assignments

## APIs

Create a set of APIs using Node.js.
The user of the API should be able to:
* Create an order with multiple items.
* Update one of the items when it is assigned to a driver for pickup.
* Return group of items taken by each driver. 

## Design the DB

This should be a simple schema that contains only order ID and item ID.

# Requirement

* Cover parts of the project with tests.
* Think about how you structure your files and folders, maintain good naming conventions, pick libraries for common tasks etc. Write the code as if this project would be extended with more functionality and be maintained by a team.

# Submission

When you're done, send us back a link to a repository with your source code, with a description of what you've done and any build instructions in the readme!
